              <h3><b> Details </b></h3>
              <p> Equinox programming challenge will be run on hackerrank.com. Teams will be provided with an account on competition day. Then, once the competition begins, teams will be left to complete as many of the challenges as possible in 4 hours. The team who completes the most challenges, or in the case of a tie the most challenges the fastest, will win!</p>
              </br>

              <h4><b>What languages can we use?</b></h4>
              <p>Hackerrank compiles and runs your code for you on its own server. This means you can use any of the 30 languages on hackerrank.com including but not limited to: Java, Python, C++, or Javascript! </p>
              </br>

              <h4><b>What experience level is necessary?</b></h4>
              <p>The first couple problems are accessible to all even with minimal programming experience. We encourage anyone who is interested, especially those currently enrolled in a CS course at their highschool, to give it a shot!</p>
              </br>

              <h4><b>What are the problems like?</b></h4>
              <p>The problems start out fairly straightforward, where the solution can be achieved by writing a simple method. However, the more challenging problems are bigger and using several methods/classes would help. Some sample problems will be made available soon!</p>
               </br>

              <h4><b>What will be provided?</b></h4>
              <p>The room has outlets. Additionally, we will provide free T-Shirts, snacks, and other miscellaneous items like pens. However, we will not be providing either lunch or dinner so please plan accordingly. </p>
               </br>

              <h4><b>What are the prizes?</b></h4>
              <p>The prizes will be announced in late September. Keep checking this website for updates!</p>
              </br>

              <h4><b>How many team members are needed on a team?</b></h4>
              <p>You can have anywhere from 1-4 team members. If you are a team of 1, still fill out the form, but email us <b>equinoxprogrammingchallenge@gmail.com</b> if you want a partner! We will try to make sure everyone can participate!</p>
              </br>

              <h4><b>I would like to add a member to my team, but I already registered.</b></h4>
              <p>Simply fill out this form to add either an additional member or add additional forms for existing members. </p>
              </br>

              <h4><b>How early should our team register?</b></h4>
